# Hi, I'm Martin 👋  
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-chovanec-02880413/) · [GitHub](https://github.com/chovanecm)

I'm a software engineer and independent developer with a focus on building practical, user-facing tools — from ServiceNow automation and developer utilities to full-stack web apps and open-source experiments.  
I enjoy turning technical curiosity into something tangible and useful.

## 🚽 [toilet.zone](https://toilet.zone)
Global web app helping travelers and locals find nearby public toilets quickly and reliably.  
The idea came after a friend from Asia pointed out how surprisingly few public toilets there are in many European cities compared to Asia — and how hard it can be to find one when you actually need it.

Built with **Next.js**, **MapLibre GL**, and **OpenStreetMap** data, toilet.zone focuses on **speed**, **clarity**, and a **clean UX**.  
Written with AI — curated, refactored, and debugged by me.

## 🧰 ServiceNow Projects

### [tsnow](https://github.com/chovanecm/tsnow)
TypeScript-based tools for **ServiceNow**.  
A toolkit designed to make development with ServiceNow APIs more reliable, type-safe, and developer-friendly.

### [snow-run-python](https://github.com/chovanecm/snow-run-python)
Platform-independent command-line interface for **ServiceNow**, written in **Python**.  
Allows developers and admins to interact with ServiceNow instances directly from the terminal. Currently supports executing local scripts on a remote ServiceNow instance.

(Supersedes the original [SnowRun](https://github.com/chovanecm/snow-run) project.)

## 🧪 Other Past Projects

### [Sacredboard](https://github.com/chovanecm/sacredboard)
A web dashboard for the **Sacred** machine-learning experiment management framework.  
Used to monitor, compare, and visualize experiment runs — simplifying ML experiment tracking long before tools like Weights & Biases became popular.

### [Pascal-Truffle](https://github.com/chovanecm/pascal-truffle)
Experimental implementation of a subset of **Pascal** using Oracle Labs’ **Truffle** framework.  
Inspired by the original Pascal language from Niklaus Wirth (ETH Zürich), exploring compiler construction and language runtime design.

### [Python Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/chovanecm/python-genetic-algorithm)
A simple library for evolutionary computation, developed as part of a course at the **Czech Technical University**.  
Supports evolving fixed-length binary genomes and basic selection/crossover/mutation mechanisms.
